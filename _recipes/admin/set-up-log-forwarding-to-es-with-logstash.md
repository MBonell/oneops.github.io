The inductor logstash-forwarder agent is installed as part of the inductor setup . For more details on inductor setup refer,

Retrieve the logstash cert from any of the ES nodes and update it at this path /logstash-forwarder/cert/logstash-forwarder.crt 

Once the cert is updated restart the inductor logstash agent via the command *inductor restart_logstash_agent cloud-name* .
