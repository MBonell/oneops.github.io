Security group is a mandatory component in all packs. It can be used to open up additional ports as required by the application.

# Solution

To add a Security Group, follow these steps:

1. Go to the design of the platform where you want to add the security group.
2. Select the **secgroup** component.
  
    ![Security Group](../../assets/local/images/secgroup.png)
  
3. In the secgroup details page, specify the multiple inbound rules as required in the form:
  
    ```
min max protocol cidr
```
  
  * Min/Max: Indicates the port range. For a single port, select both as the same value.
  * protocol: tcp/udp/icmp
  * cidr: IP range in CIDR format. Select 0.0.0.0/0 to apply to all IPs
