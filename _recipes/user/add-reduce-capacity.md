# Solution

Capacity equals deployment. 100% capacity is deployment of all instances in the cloud. Partial deployments are usually used to test new code or components. After the partial deployment is recognized as successful, a full deployment can be executed.

Two processes are required to change capacity:

* **Transition** provides visibility into the variable set and allows you to execute a partial or full deployment.
* **Operate** allows you to control capacity and execute a full deployment.

# Transition

TBD Check Scaling Configuration follows pattern

Transition > Environment > Platform > Summary > Scaling Configuration

1. To view the environments page, click **Transition.**
2. Select a platform.

The Summary page displays the Scaling Configuration panel.

# Operate

You can only complete a full deployment in Operate.

Operate > Summary tab > Force Deployment

To execute a full deployment, complete the following steps:

1. Select the appropriate assembly.
2. Click **Operate.**
3. Select an environment (for example, prod2).
  The summary tab displays status information.

4. Click **Force Deploy.**

>Force Deploy gathers all changes made to that environment, regardless of how small or large, up to the moment you click **Force Deploy.**
