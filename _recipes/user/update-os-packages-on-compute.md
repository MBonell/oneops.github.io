# Solution

To update OS packages on a compute:

1. Go to the operation phase of the compute component.
2. Select the computes you want to update with latest OS packages and click **Action.**
  
    ![Update OS Package Compute](../../assets/local/images/update-os-package-compute.png)
  
3. Select upgrade-os-all.
4. Select the set size.
5. Start the procedure.
  
    ![Update OS Package Compute New](../../assets/local/images/update-os-package-compute-new.png)

**This updates the existing OS packages to the new version available and also installs any new packages which are required.**

NOTE: All Kernel-related patch updates require a compute reboot. After the packages are installed, do a rolling reboot of computes.
