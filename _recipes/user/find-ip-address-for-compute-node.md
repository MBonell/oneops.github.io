# Solution

To find the IP address of a compute node, follow these steps:

1. Click **Operate.**
2. Select the environment.
3. Select the platform.
4. Select the compute component from the list.
5. To find the public IP field of each compute and select its **configuration** tab.

CAUTION: A node's IP Address may change, so you need to make sure that you do not build in reliance on an IP address in your application or operations. Think of an IP Address in OneOps as a PID (a process ID number). Whenever a compute goes through repair or replace activities, the compute may come out with a new IP Address.
