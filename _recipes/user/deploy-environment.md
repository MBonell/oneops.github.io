To deploy an environment, follow these steps:

1. Click **deploy.**
  * The deployment plan is created and the event is published.
  * The Controller reacts on the “new deployment” event, changes the deployment state to “in progress”, and dispatches Workorders from step 1 to Inductors.
  * The inductors consume the Workorders.
  * Call provider API instantiates the Compute, Storage, etc.
  * After the compute is up, there is an ssh remote execution of Chef recipes to deploy software, configuration, monitors, etc.
  * The inductor sends the Workorder result back to the Controller to update the CMS.
7. After all Workorders from step 1 are successfully processed, move to the next step. 
    
    Metrics and Logs are collected (via flume) to Cassandra.
