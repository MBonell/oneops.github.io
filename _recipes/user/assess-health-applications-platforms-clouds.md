3. Select the environment.
     
    The Environments page defaults to the summary tab that displays a status for the following conditions:  
  * Platforms
  * Deployment
  * Health
  * Auto repair
     
    The health is displayed, including the number of instances in the environment. 
  * Good = green
  * Disabled = red

4. Click the graph tab to display an overall view of the health of the application.
    
    ![](../../assets/local/images/assess-health-graph.png)
    
5. From the graph, view the overall health of the environment. 
  
    Each component is represented by a circle icon. The color of the icon indicates the component condition:
    
  * Green: The environment is healthy and no action needs to be taken.
  * Orange: A change is being executed. This could mean a deployment to that instance or that the instance is undergoing an auto repair.
  * Red: Click on a red-colored component to investigate. Drill down to see the status of the component.
