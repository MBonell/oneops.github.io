Deployment approval is a mechanism by which a team can govern deployment of environment attributed with approval flag

Key information about approval process
- Create a new support object to the specific clouds who require approval
- The support object can be added/removed from cloud by users with support permissions
- Only users with Support permission to the cloud can approve the deployment record associated with the cloud
- Multiple approval records will be generated for deployment corresponding to the number of support objects per clouds. Few or all approval records can be approved or rejected with single API call.

7. Add users/groups to the team, to provide this support access
