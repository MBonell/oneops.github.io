# Solution

Use Operations to perform operations on a component. Each component has specific controls.

To work with the controls for an environment, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Operations.**
2. Select the environment.
3. Select the component.
  
* Summary:
  * Compute: Status, Reboot, upgrade-os-security, powercycle, repair, upgrade-os-all
  * Tomcat/Jboss: Status, Stop, Start, Restart, Repair, Debug
  * Artifact: Repair, Redeploy, Custom User Attachment
  * And more...
* Configuration: Displays the latest configuration deployed on the compute. It is possible to Replace or Cancel the Active deployment here.
* Monitors: Displays the graphs for the monitors that are associated with the component. Read more details at [Monitor Types](../references/#monitor-types).
* Logs: TBD
* Procedures: Displays the procedures that are called from Operations.
