* Define a cost structure for all cloud services offerings
* Set limits/quotas on cloud service allocations (actual + reserved) of cloud services offerings per assembly
* Reporting on current cloud service allocation (actual + reserved)

* Cloud service offerings information in CMS with index in ES to capture the unit resource costs associated with consuming cloud resources (to be used both for tracking  
Cost as well as for active quota limits)

* Relationships between assembly environments and cloud offerings in CMS with index in ES to capture the current allocations, actual + reserved. (to be used for current allocation 
Reports and for real-time quota limits)

* Deployment time cost capture in ES as part of the workorders to capture the actual utilization of resources over time (to be used as historical event stream for showback and chargeback reporting)
