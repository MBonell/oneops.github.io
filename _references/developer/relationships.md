Relationships have attributes like other objects modeled in OneOps. We are working on adding pages to visualize and explain all of them.

There are two primary relationships used in packs:

* `depends_on` Sets the order of deployment and dependency tree for escalation
* `managed_via` How to know where to connect for management. In most cases, this is a compute, but in some, it is a cluster or ring.

Relationships are modeled like [components](../key-concepts/#component), with the same directory structure. Relationships also have attributes.

For more detail regarding relations for Design, Transition and Operations, see [Relations](../references/#relations).
