Each Platform has a set of Components (optional and required) that are predefined by a Platform template.

Each Component has configuration attributes that are specific to the type of Component. Components, like Platforms, have interdependencies that are used during the generation of a deployment plan. On the Platform detail page, there is a diagram and a list of Components. The list is grouped by Component type with an indication of the number of Components within each group.

After all changes are committed, you can move on to Transition to realize/promote your design/changes to the new/existing environment.
