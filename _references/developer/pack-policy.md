title: Pack policy

Policies can also be specified as part of the pack definition.The policy definition needs to added to the pack .rb file.
This enables policy evaluation on all the CIs under the platform for the given pack. The violated policies can then be 
fixed to avoid issues further down the application lifecycle. 

Following are few examples of pack based policies.

~~~ruby
policy "env-profile",
       :description => 'custom pack policy for env-profile',
       :query => 'ciClassName:manifest.Environment AND _missing_:ciAttributes.profile'
       :docUrl => '<document url link for the policy>'`
       :mode => 'passive'

policy "compute-ostype",
       :description => 'custom pack policy for compute-ostype',
       :query => 'ciClassName:(catalog.*Compute manifest.*Compute bom.*Compute) AND NOT ciAttributes.ostype:("centos-6.5" OR "centos-6.6" OR "redhat-6.5" OR "redhat-6.6" OR "default-cloud")'
       :docUrl => '<document url link for the policy>'`
       :mode => 'active'

policy "env-automation",
       :description => 'custom pack policy for env-automation',
       :query => 'ciClassName:manifest.Environment AND ciAttributes.profile:(PROD EBF STAGING) AND NOT (ciAttributes.autorepair:true AND ciAttributes.autoreplace:true)'
       :docUrl => '<document url link for the policy>'`
       :mode => 'passive'

Brief description about each field in the policy definition is as follows
 
 * **Description:**  Brief description about the Policy.
 * **Query:** Elastic Search query to identify candidate objects that violate the policy.
 * **Doc URL:** URL to the document about the policy details.
 * **Mode:** Can be Active/Passive.
     * **Active:** Prohibits users from saving objects under violation. For example: A policy can be defined to allow only a few compute images like centos-6.6, redhat 6.5. Any attempt to save a compute component with an image value other than these two, fails.
     * **Passive:** All components and instances that violate such policies are marked with a failed policy status with the reason for the specific policy failures.
