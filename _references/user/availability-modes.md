Availability modes are set when you create an environment. They can be set globally or by Platform.

There are two availability modes:

* **Single:** Usually creates one compute per platform.
* **Redundant:** Adds load balancers, clusters, rings (whatever is the Best Practice for the Platform). Allows configuration of minimum and maximum scale options.
