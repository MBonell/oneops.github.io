How to Set Up Azure for OneOps

Roughly follow these directions <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal/#authenticate-with-password---azure-cli>, but you don't need all of it.  This is the abridged version.

## Prerequisites

This assumes you have the Azure CLI installed and in ARM mode.

## Create an Application in Azure Active Directory

Create some application in Azure's Active Directory (AD).  This will be the client that OneOps uses to control Azure.  The name and URL values are not important, but should not clash with anything else in AD.

{% highlight shell lineos %}
  azure ad app create --name "someapp" --password "dontusethis" \
    --home-page "https://someapp.azure.example.com" \
    --identifier-uris "https://someapp.azure.example.com/someapp"
{% endhighlight %}

This will return a few things:

{% highlight shell lineos %}
results
    info:    Executing command ad app create
    + Creating application someapp
    data:    AppId:                   {CLIENT_ID}
    data:    ObjectId:                abcd1234-bbbb-cccc-dddd-654321fedcba
    data:    DisplayName:             someapp
    data:    IdentifierUris:          0=https://someapp.azure.example.com/someapp <https://someapp.azure.example.com/cliapp>
    data:    ReplyUrls:
    data:    AvailableToOtherTenants:  False
    info:    ad app create command OK
{% endhighlight %}

App ID is your **client ID**.  The password you supplied is your **client secret**.  The application can be found in Azure's AD now.


## Create a Service Principal

Use the App ID (Client ID) to create a service principal.

{% highlight shell lineos %}
azure ad sp create {CLIENT_ID}
{% endhighlight %}

Again, this returns the following:

{% highlight shell lineos %}
results
    info:    Executing command ad sp create
    + Creating service principal for application {CLIENT_ID}
    data:    Object Id:               {SP_ID}
    data:    Display Name:            someapp
    data:    Service Principal Names:
    data:                             {CLIENT_ID}
    data:                             https://someapp.azure.example.com/someapp <https://someapp.azure.example.com/someapp>
    info:    ad sp create command OK
{% endhighlight %}

This has added a key to the application in Azure AD.  You won't be able to see it's value.

## Grant the Service Principal Permissions

Use the Object ID {SP_ID} returned above to assign the service principal **Contributor** permission to the scope of your subscription using your subscription ID (this may be too loose for real usage).

{% highlight shell lineos %}
azure role assignment create --objectId {SP_ID} -o Contributor -c /subscriptions/{YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/
{% endhighlight %}

## Setup OneOps

You can now use the Client ID (App ID) and Client Secret (password) when configuring your Azure cloud.
