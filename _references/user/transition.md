After you create a new Environment, the Environment detail page (Manifest page) displays. This is where you see the realization of your Design into a given Environment that is based on its SLA requirements.

All configuration values for Platforms and Components are pulled from the Assembly Design. You may also see additional required/optional Components in some Platforms based on Env properties.

# Pull Design

Every time a new change is committed to the Assembly Design, you see the notification on the Transition summary/Manifest page. You have the option to promote those changes into this Manifest.

# Manifest Configuration

On the Manifest page, you can make configuration changes that are specific to your Environment. To mark these as permanent, click the lock icon next to the attribute value. Otherwise these get overwritten the next time you perform a Design pull.
