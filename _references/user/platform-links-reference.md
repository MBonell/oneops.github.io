A User can set `Links To` dependencies between Platforms within an Assembly. These dependencies are used to generate a proper deployment sequence for the Platforms. For example, when you link a web Platform to a database Platform, the database deploys first. Then, when the web Platform comes up, the database Platform is ready.
