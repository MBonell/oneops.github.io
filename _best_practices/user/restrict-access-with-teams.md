Use Teams to restrict user access to an organization. Create [teams](../howto/#create-a-team-in-an-organization), add users to those teams, and then provide only the necessary privileges to each team.

# Discussion

This should be done by the organization admin. After creating a team, it can be given a permission to have access to Design, Transition and Operations phases.

>Do not make every user an admin. Admin access should be limited to selected users in an organization.
