# Good Defaults
* Have reasonable defaults for resources included in pack.
 * For example, What would be **default** value of **compute size** for tomcat.


# Use Variables



Some of the use case for variables would be:
  1. If you use the same value in multiple places in the platform and you want
  them in sync
  2. Very frequently used attributes so the user doesn’t need to drill-down
  - like version of an artifact
  3. attributes that the user ​*must*​ change, like name of the app or something like that

  >The variables are de-referenced during the deployment plan generation on OneOps
  and  by the time the attribute is passed to the cookbook (workorder) it’s already substituted
