Our code is publicly available in several repos at GitHub: https://github.com/oneops

We utilize **Github Issues** for issue tracking and contributions. You can contribute in two ways:

1. Report an issue or make a feature request [here](#issues).
2. Add features, fix bugs yourself, or contribute your code.

# Contributing Code or Documentation

For small changes — little bugfixes, correcting typos, and the like — please just submit pull requests to any of our projects. 
For larger changes, though, we have to ask you to electronically sign a statement that indicates two things:

1. You are willingly licensing your contributions under the terms of the open source license of the project that you’re contributing to.

2. You are legally able to license your contributions as stated.

Once you sign the Contributor License Agreement (the “CLA”), we will then be able to merge your contributions with a clear conscience and with only the friction that results from the usual technical back-and-forth of a vibrant open source project.

To get started with this process, visit the [Sign the CLA page](https://github.com/oneops/OneOps/blob/master/sign-cla.md).

Create [Pull-Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on your branch from master and we will review and merge.

# Code Review Process

Each Github pull request will go through 3 step before merge:

1. We will execute our automated test cases against the pull request. If the tests failed the pull request will be rejected with comments provided on the failures.
2. If tests pass, the OneOps engineering team member will do the review of the changes. Technical communication possible via github.com pull request page. When ready, your pull request will be tagged with label `Ready For Merge`.
3. Your patch will be merged into `master` including necessary documentation updates and you will be included in `CHANGELOG.md`. 


# Apache 2.0 License

OneOps uses the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/oneops/oneops/blob/master/LICENSE) and any changes or enhancements will also use that license.

# <a name="issues"></a> OneOps Issue Tracking

OneOps Issue Tracking is handled using Github Issues.

If you are familiar with OneOps and know the repository that is causing you a problem or if you
  have a feature request on a specific component, you can file an issue in the corresponding
  GitHub project. All of our Open Source Software can be found in our
  [GitHub organization](https://github.com/oneops/).

Otherwise you can file your issue in the [OneOps project](https://github.com/oneops/oneops/issues)
  and we will make sure it gets filed against the appropriate project.

To decrease the back and forth in issues, and to help us get to the bottom of them quickly,
  we use the issue template below. You can copy/paste this template into the issue you are opening and
  edit it accordingly.

<a name="issuetemplate"></a>

```

### Version:
[Version of the project installed]

### Environment:
[Details about the environment such as the Operating System, cookbook details, etc.]

### Scenario:
[What you are trying to achieve and you can't?]

### Steps to Reproduce:
[If you are filing an issue, what are the things we need to do to reproduce your problem?]

### Expected Result:
[What are you expecting to happen as the consequence of the reproduction steps above?]

### Actual Result:
[What actually happens after the reproduction steps?]

```

### Useful Github Queries

Contributions go through a review process to improve code quality and avoid regressions. Managing a large number of contributions requires a workflow to provide queues for work such as triage, code review, and merging. A semi-formal process has evolved over the life of the project. Chef maintains this process pending community development and acceptance of an [RFC](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc). These queries help track contributions through this process:
